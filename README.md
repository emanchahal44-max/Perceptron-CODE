# Perceptron-CODE
# Perceptron from Scratch – Iris Dataset 

This project implements a **Perceptron classifier from scratch** using **NumPy**, without relying on built-in machine learning models.  
The model is trained and tested on the **Iris dataset** to classify whether a flower is **Iris-setosa or not**.

Project Overview

- Perceptron implemented manually using gradient-based weight updates
- Sigmoid activation function used for prediction
- Dataset: Iris (from UCI Machine Learning Repository)
- Binary classification:
  - `1` → Iris-setosa  
  - `0` → Not Iris-setosa
- Supports **manual user input** for prediction
- Reports **test accuracy**
- Learning Rate (`eta`): 0.01  
- Number of Iterations (`n_iter`): 50  
- Activation Function: Sigmoid  
- Loss Handling: Threshold-based classification error count
